# Luck vs Math: A Casino Roulette Simulation

## 🎯 Project Overview
This project simulates roulette outcomes to visualize the inevitable losses players experience over time.  
The main motivation is to demonstrate that there is no winning strategy in a casino—the house always wins in the long run.

The simulation includes:
- **Three strategies**:  

  - Martingale Strategy  
  - Conservative Betting  
  - Compulsive Gambling  
- **Multiple games** (8 tables) to calculate averages and visualize results.

## 📊 Features
- Simulates European roulette with realistic probabilities.
- Implements multiple betting strategies.
- Tracks balance changes over time.
- Visualizes individual runs and mean performance across multiple games using **Matplotlib**.
